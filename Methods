Methods
Bulk RNA sequencing and single cell sample demultiplexing For each sample, cells was processed in Trizol using the miRNAeasy micro kit (QIAGEN, Germantown,
MD) and standard RNA sequencing libraries were generated using Illumina Truseq library preparation kits. These libraries were used to generate SNP calls 
for each donor. Sequencing results were demultiplexed and converted to FASTQ format using Illumina bcl2fastq software. The sequencing reads were adaptor
and quality trimmed and then aligned to the human genome using the splice-aware STAR aligner and SNP calls were generated using the previously published 
protocol (Blay et al., 2019). We used the software package demuxlet (Kang et al., 2018) to then match single cells in the 10x RNaseq data to each donor 
and identify doublets. Because multiple samples from different time points for each donor may be collected and could not be demultiplexed by this method 
alone, we also used ‘hashtag’ antibodies (Biolegend) to uniquely label the different time points (Stoeckius et al., 2018).
